Welcome to my github/project for the Capital One SWE Summit Challenge

All the files I coded for my live website are located in this repository.

I used python to code the Web App with Flask as my framework. Flask is a microframework which incorporates Werkzeug, Jinja 2, and others.

More info on Flask Can be found Here: http://flask.pocoo.org

In Addition to the National Park Service API I also used the Google Maps API for static google map images.
API Documentation can be found here:

Google Maps API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/intro
National Park Service API: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm

Deployment of the Web App was done with Heroku
More information on Heroku can be found here: https://www.heroku.com/what



NOTE: The National Park Service API does have a Rate Limit that can be a bit cumbersome to deal with at times. If for some reason the Web App does not work, it is most liekly a result of the Rate Limit was reached. If this occurs, you can wait an hour and the Rate Limit should reset and thw web app should work properly again.
